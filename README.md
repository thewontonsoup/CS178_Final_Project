# CS178_Final_Project
An upload of the final project of UCI's Machine Learning Course.

Using the Dataset from the Toxic Comment Dataset from Kaggle, we constructed multiple models including Logistic Regression and SGD Classifier. We were able to achieve a hamming loss of 2.53% with TfidVectorizer with 2500 max_features with a Logistic Regression model. Additional Information can be found with the attached pdf.
